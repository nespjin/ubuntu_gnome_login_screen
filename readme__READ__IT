This is theme nearly looks like macOS lockscreen , with script which can set wallpaper for your desktop and simultaneously set same wallpaper on lock screen and login screen with blur effect like on macOS. In attachment you will find file ubuntu.css, where injected some changes, to make your login screen and lock screen looks more like mac OS.

ATTENTION: TESTED AND WORK ONLY ON UBUNTU 19.04 Disco Dingo. 


For Ubuntu 19.04 (Disco Dingo) download files:
High_Ubunterra_DD-X.X(noPass).tar.xz
High_Ubunterra_DD-X.X(Pass).tar.xz

Not work on few monitors ( Just don't have second monitor so i can't develop work version (-_-) Sorry ).

Two versions: 
High_Ubunterra_X.X(noPass) - without asking password to set wallpaper but script give full permission for root folder " /usr/share/backgrounds/ " by chmod 777 (not safety).
High_Ubunterra_X.X(Pass) - with asking password each time you set wallpaper for change background of " lockscreen ", it is safe, but not comfortable for user.
